 Speed of sound  c = 343 m/s 

 Length (Depth) (Lx) of room =   6.25 m
 Width (Ly) of room =   3.75 m
 Height (Lz) of room =   2.50 m

 RT60 estimate: Air absorption makes  3.79 percent difference in this room.

 Reverberation Times by Norris_Eyring estimator
 At frequency =    125 Hz RT60 =   0.1907 s
 At frequency =    250 Hz RT60 =   0.1907 s
 At frequency =    500 Hz RT60 =   0.2728 s
 At frequency =   1000 Hz RT60 =   0.2721 s
 At frequency =   2000 Hz RT60 =   0.1891 s
 At frequency =   4000 Hz RT60 =   0.2628 s

 Estimate of Room break frequencies (uses mean of above RT60's =   0.2297 s),
 F1 =     55 Hz. Lowest room mode, i.e. below F1 no resonant support for sound in room
 Between F1 and F2 room modes dominate
 F2 =    118 Hz. Approximate cutoff (crossover) frequency
 Between F2 and F3 diffraction and diffusion dominate
 F3 =    474 Hz. Above F3 specular reflections and ray acoustics are valid
